Problem 1
Cold Storage started its operations in Jan 2016. They are in the business of storing Pasteurized Fresh
Whole or Skimmed Milk, Sweet Cream, Flavoured Milk Drinks. To ensure that there is no change of
texture, body appearance, separation of fats the optimal temperature to be maintained is between 2º - 4º
C.
In the first year of business, they outsourced the plant maintenance work to a professional company with stiff
penalty clauses. It was agreed that if it was statistically proven that the probability of temperature going
outside the 2º - 4º C during the one-year contract was above 2.5% and less than 5% then the penalty would
be 10% of AMC (annual maintenance case). In case it exceeded 5% then the penalty would be 25% of the
AMC fee.

Problem 2
In Mar 2018, Cold Storage started getting complaints from their clients that they have been getting complaints from
end consumers of the dairy products going sour and often smelling. On getting these complaints, the supervisor
pulls out data of the last 35 days’ temperatures. As a safety measure, the Supervisor has been vigilant to maintain
the mean temperature 3.9º C or below.
Assume 3.9º C as the upper acceptable mean temperature and at alpha = 0.1 do you feel that there is a
need for some corrective action in the Cold Storage Plant or is it that the problem is from the procurement
side from where Cold Storage is getting the Dairy Products
